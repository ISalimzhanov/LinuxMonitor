# LinuxMonitor


### GUI component 
This component is responsible for the application interface.
We used JavaFx for creation of the GUI part of Linux Monitor project. We can see time for which application is running and choose the date to see processes information as table for this date.

There are three classes and one fxml for the layout:

* TrackerTimer: <br /> 
*This class holds time and state of timer*  
* Controller: <br />
*This class is for interaction logic with user. It is responsible for click listeners and table creation with processes information.* 
* Main: <br />
*Main class for running program. It loads sample.fxml layout.*
